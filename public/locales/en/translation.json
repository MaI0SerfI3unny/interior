    "q1": "How does the interior design generator work?",
    "a1": "Our generator uses powerful artificial intelligence algorithms to create unique interior designs based on your wishes. Choose a style, room type, upload a photo of your room and the system will automatically generate a visualization of your space.",
    "q2": "What is a prompt and how to write one?",
    "a2": "A prompt is your task or request to the design generator (for example, to create an image, text, or explain something). To get a good result, you should clearly and clearly describe what you want. Here are some tips on how to write a successful prompt: <ol class='list'><li key='1'>Write simply and specifically. Instead of “draw something beautiful,” it is better to: “create an image of a cozy room with a wooden floor, light walls, and a large window.”</li><li key='2'>Add details. The more details (colors, style, emotions, time of day, etc.) — the more accurate the result.</li><li key='3'>Don't be afraid to try! If the result doesn't suit you the first time — change or clarify your request. That's okay.</li></ol>",
    "q3": "Can I use the platform without registering?",
    "a3": "No, to access all the platform's features, you need to register. Registration allows you to save your designs, access personalized settings. You can register via email or social networks.",
    "q4": "Where are my generated images stored?",
    "a4": "All generated designs are stored on our platform in your personal profile. You can access your images at any time and download them to your device.",
    "q5": "Is there a limit on the number of designs created?",
    "a5": "The number of designs created depends on the selected tariff plan. For the free plan, there is a limit on the number of generated images, while for paid plans more options are available. You can check the pricing details on our pricing page.",
    "q6": "How can I change my pricing plan?",
    "a6": "You can change your pricing plan at any time by going to the 'My Account' section and selecting the appropriate option. The change in pricing will be applied instantly without any interruption in the platform's use.",
    "q7": "Can I change the design after it has been created?",
